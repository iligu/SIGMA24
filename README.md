This will be uploaded once the conference proceedings are published on Nature. Meanwhile, here is the abstract:

Electric Vehicle Dynamic Wireless Charging stations, which use road infrastructure to charge electric vehicles (EVs), play a crucial role in communities as EVs have become commercially viable. This paper employs a multi-criteria decision-making model (MCDM) based on social, environmental and developmental parameters to optimise their location. Based on literature, TOPSIS was used to provide a ranking based on expert weightage on seven criteria in Connecticut. Results reveal that Fairfield and New Haven Counties are the most optimal locations, with scores of 0.64 and 0.62 respectively. This is proven effective in evaluating counties based on their TOPSIS scores.
